# arf154 

Arf154 is an arduino compatible wireless network ready board.

The board core is the atsamr21q1x SoC. The device integrates a Cortex-M0 and a
IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver.

## Footprint

The design is targeting to be as compatible as possible with Teensy3.1 boards.

## How to program

The board can be programmed using the USB connector or trough the EMDBG using 
any Atmel software tools.

## Libraries

At this moment, there's no library but basic wireless communication libraries 
will be added in near future. Support for advanced features, as mesh network,
will be added later.

The board also is compatible with zigbee, 6lowpan and other network standart.

## Status

At this moment the schematics are almost done.
